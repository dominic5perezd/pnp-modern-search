### Check existing issues before logging new ones

### Questions related to data mapping, e.g. SharePoint columns to crawled properties to managed properties, will be closed by default and should be asked elsewhere as it's outside the scope of this project. However if you cannot repro the issue with classic web parts, then it's ok as it relates to these web parts ðŸ™‚

__Remove the above section before submitting, and removal of the below template will result in the issue being closed.__

**Version used**
Ex: 4.2

**Question**
A clear and concise description of what the scenario. Keep questions related to the web parts. If the issue relates to KQL or question around crawled and managed properties please use [Microsoft TechCommunity](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/sharepoint-developer/bd-p/SharePointDev). Which means, if you experience the same behavior in classic web parts, then it's not an issue with PnP Modern Search ðŸ˜‰

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your scenario.

**Additional context**
Add any other context which is helpful to understand the question.
