# PnP Modern Search v4 (preview)

The PnP 'Modern Search' solution is a set of SharePoint Online modern Web Parts allowing SharePoint super users, webmasters and developers to create highly flexible and personalized search based experiences in minutes.

**Looking for the v3 documentation? [Here you go!](./v3/index.md)**

!!! important "PnP Modern Search v3.x deprecation"
    **The v4 version uses a brand new code architecture and replaces the older v3 codebase**. There will be no new features added to v3.x, but we will continue to
    provide bug fixes as needed. Because v4.x is not at feature parity yet with v3.x, you can still use the v3.x packages to meet your requirements. Also, there is not an
    auto-upgrade path from v3 to v4 due to the new architecture, so you are perfectly ok
    to stay on the v3 version until v4 provides the features validating your upgrade.
    However, the main focus is on the v4 version, and new search functionality backed by the Microsoft Graph Search API will be v4 only.

    **v3 and v4 don't share the same Web Part and solution IDs meaning you can have them side by side on a page if necessary without overlap. However, in this case, you will have to rename *.sppkg files to be able to upload both versions in your App Catalog because they share the same SPFx package name `pnp-modern-search-parts.sppkg`.**

## What's included?

The solution includes the following Web Parts:

| Component | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| **[Search Results](./usage/search-results/index.md)** | Retrieve data from a data source and render them in a specific layout.
| **[Search Filters](./usage/search-filters/index.md)** | Filter and refine data displayed in 'Search Results' Web Parts.
| **[Search Verticals](./usage/search-verticals/index.md)** | Browse data as silos (i.e. tabs) from multiple data sources.
| **[Search box](./usage/search-box/index.md)** | Let users enter free text queries sent to 'Search Results' Web Parts.

## Supported browsers

Here is the list of supported browsers:

- Chrome
- Firefox
- Edge
- Edge Chromium
- Brave

**We don't support Internet Explorer 11**. We think there are plenty of other options for enteprise scenarios in the market. Maybe it's time to move on. For developers, it represents an **huge** ammount of time to make the solution compatible for a very low benefit. Hope you understand, ain't personal ;).

## Extensibility model

By getting this solution, you also benefit from an advanced [extensibility model](./extensibility/index.md) allowing you to customize the solution according to your requirements if default features don't do the job for you. 

**The supported extensions are:**

- [Custom web components](./extensibility/custom_web_component.md).
- [Custom suggestions providers](./extensibility/custom_suggestions_provider.md).
- [Custom Handlebars customization (helpers, partials, etc.)](./extensibility/handlebars_customizations.md).

With these available customizations options, you can do pretty much anything!
