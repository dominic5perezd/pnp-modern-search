# Scenarios

This section of the documentation provides some scenario-based recipes for building solutions with the PnP Modern Search Web Parts. It can vbe confusing to look across the documentation for ways to solve specific needs, so these scenarios may help. Wherever possible, we link back to the core documentation rather than explaining actions in duplicate.
