# Scenarios

This section of the documentation provides some scenario-based recipes for building solutions with the PnP Modern Search Web Parts. It can vbe confusing to look across the documentation for ways to solve specific needs, so these scenarios may help. Wherever possible, we link back to the core documentation rather than explaining actions in duplicate.

## Scenario 1

[Create a simple search page](create-simple-search-page.md)

We can create a search-driven experience simply by adding the PmP Modern Search Web Parts to a page: Search Box and Search Results.

## Scenario 2

[Set up Managed Properties](set-up-managed-properties.md)

The first step in setting up search-driven solutions is getting the appropriate infrastructure in place. Most search solutions require some filters (aks refiners) to allow the user to filter the initial results.

## Scenario 3

[Build a page showing content with filters which are Managed Metadata columns](using-managed-metadata.md)

Managed Metadata columns can be tricky to work with because of the way they are managed and stored in the platform. In this scenario, we step through the process of setting up a simple search experience page with a Managed Metadata column used as a filter.

* Rolling up Hub News (in yet another way!) - Jim Love @jimmywim
* Hooking up to the Suite Bar Search (combined with Set-PnPSearchSettings) - Jim Love @jimmywim
* Creating a simple People Directory - Jim Love @jimmywim
* How to use the search results as a "content query" to show a list of sites - Marijn Somers @marijnsomers
* How to properly set the select fields (when they don't show up)!  I end up exporting page to pnp template file, tweaking the select fields using text editor, saving template, then importing the page back in. - Brian McCullough @bpmccullough
