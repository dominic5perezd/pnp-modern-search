# Scenario 2: Set up Managed Properties

## Set up Site Columns

## Add Site Columns to Content Type(s)

## Enable Content Type(s) on lists or libraries

## Add content using Site Columns

Crawled properties won't exist unless there is content which has values for the Site Columns.

## Wait for content crawl

You can't search for content unless it has been crawled. In SharePoint Online, this usually only takes a few minutes for new content, though it can take longer if the tenant's servers are under load.
